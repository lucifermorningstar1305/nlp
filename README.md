This branch is solely dedicated to my understanding and implementation of the NLP algorithms that are being taught by the [National Research University Higher School of Economics](https://www.hse.ru/en/) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/language-processing/home/welcome) 🧑‍🏫. 

I'll be updating this repo as I keep learning new algorithms in NLP. 

## INFO ℹ️

All the notebooks are ordered sequential so that it's easy not only for you access and understand but also for me 😝. 

The `utils.py` contains some code related to text-preprocessing.
